Software product lines have helped to reduce costs and the time-to-market in different application domain areas. However, employing SPL for web development has received little attention. In this work, we propose a framework to develop web systems based on product-line architectures.  Our approach accelerates the development process by raising the level of abstraction of the customization procedures to maintain and evolve web product lines.  We develop a prototype to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
